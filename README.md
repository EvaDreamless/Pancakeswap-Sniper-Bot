# AbstractSniper | Pancakeswap
------------  
  A free sniper bot built to work with Pancakeswap. Honeypot/rug checker built in. Bot allows you to compete with other trading bots when buying a token on PancakeSwap. Its faster than traditional bots because it watches the txpool/mempool where transactions are still "pending" on the BSC network. It will watch for when liquidity is added as a pending transaction and immediately submit your order, so that hopefully you get in right after liquidity is added and before everyone else.
